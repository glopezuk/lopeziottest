Hi Team

My idea is to use a esp32 board to collect some data and show it on the phone over the captive portal of wifimanager.h i will keep adding more details about this idea.

Hardware:

ESP32 = ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1
ENC28J60 Ethernet Board

the enc28j60 has to work in promiscuous mode to collect some specific data

Esp32 board details = http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/hardware/ESP32-S3_Pin_Reference

This is the list of files of the project
